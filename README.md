# playlist-stream
## A tool that allows you to listen to Youtube videos without being on Youtube watching. Good for podcasts, ASMR and music.

### Why?

I listen daily at work to ASMR and old music that I can only find on Youtube but I hate to have a browser tab that I can't close and a video running just to listen to the audio.
This tool allows you to create a playlist on Youtube and listen to it without having to load the entire video or using a browser tab.

### Why is it special?

It's not. This is good for me, and for you if you have the same problem. I plan to add some nice features in the future to make it special but for now it's just a "Youtube audio player" that I'm developing to improve my Python skills.
I have some nice ideas about the ASMR part so maybe this tool can become an ASMR app, who knows.

For now the only interesting idea that I have is to make it work with **timestamps**. If a video contains timestamps in the description this tool will let you choose where to skip anytime you want. This can be useful for full albums, ASMR videos, multi topic podcasts, ecc...
